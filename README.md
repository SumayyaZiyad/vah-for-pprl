# vah-for-pprl
This repository stores the implementation of Vulnerability-Aware Hardening (VAH), a novel reference set based hardening
technique introduced for PPRL. This work has been submitted at the Conference on Information and Knowledge Management
(CIKM) 2025.

We provide anonymised versions of all data sets used to evaluate VAH in the `data` folder.
